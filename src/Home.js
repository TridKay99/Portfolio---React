        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>My name is Tristan Kay and I am a film editor with 7 years of experience and am skillful in many programs. I have been involved in editing Dance recitals, Promotional Videos, Short films, Gym exercise videos and Music Videos. I completed my early and secondary school education at Scotch College where I recieved full colours in Athletics and Rugby. After school I continued my education and I received a Bachelor's degree in film and television at SAE Qantm.
        After university I followed my passion of film and focused mainly on film editing. My work received an award at the Dungog Film Festival and I have obtained many positive reviews for my editing. Focusing mainly on music videos, I have produced and edited over 10 videos myself.
        My experience and confidence with coding will solidify myself as a vital member of many potential teams as I have skills in ruby, html, css, and many more. I am also extremely interested in independent productions and collaborating with others to create intellectual property. Throughout my working career I have received skills in hospitality, government funded social research and inhouse film editing for ‘Big Review Tv’. Working with many other companies has introduced me to multiple co-workers and their respective teams to show I can fit in. My passions see myself fixated on a computer screen but with my filming skills it shows I work well out of the computer room. My vast and award winning experience shows the incredibly capable worker that I am. </p>
